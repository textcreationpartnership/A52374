            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The Inexpediency of the Expedient.</head>
            <p>VVHen I firſt beheld the foreſaid Paper with its Painted Face, and Tired Head like another <hi>Jezabel</hi> looking out of the Window, I had thought that long ere this, it would have been thrown down, and tore in peeces by ſome able and powerful hand in an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer; but finding as yet of no eſſay that way, and knowing withal, that ſilence does nouriſh and feed an Error; that it doth feaſt and banquet it ſo, that it is ſtrengthned and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, and ſhoots up and ſprouts and grows by it: And leaſt it might acquire the title of an undoubted truth, and ſit, and rule, and preſcribe in the hearts of ſome with <hi>a nemine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicente;</hi> therefore I thought it my duty (weak as I am) to encounter this great Champion, who ſo boldly ſtalks and vaunts himſelf, and throws down his Gantlet, and bids defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and that in the ſight of the Sun, to all that will abet our preſent Government, and ſo by a covert Conſequence, and by a tacite Inference, to all that will abet our preſent moſt Illuſtrious Governor.</p>
            <p>And though I am in the way of writing, but as a dry Tree, and as a withered Leaf; and though I am for the preſent made an Eunuch, and do lie under a Caſtration by being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of the Armor of Books, which might aſſiſt me in this combat, and ſo a good Cauſe may receive ſome hurts and wounds, through the unskilfulneſs, or weakneſs, or naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Defendant; yet though I have neither Sword, nor Spear, nor Helmet of Braſs, nor Coat of Male upon me: Yet naked as I am, with a ſling and a ſtone, I ſhall encounter this <hi>Goliah.</hi> And leaſt I ſhould ſeem to build the Gates of <hi>Mindus,</hi> which were bigger then the City, I ſhall directly come to an Anſwer to all that is in that Paper, and to all the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:64116:3"/>Six <hi>Stanza</hi>'s (if they may be ſo called) or <hi>Sections,</hi> or <hi>Pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings,</hi> or <hi>Chaſmas,</hi> or <hi>Diſtinguiſhments</hi> that are there ſet down.</p>
            <p>I ſhall begin with the Frontiſpeice, which like an intoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating <hi>Philter</hi> fairly made up and gilded, has yet within it poyſonous and deſtructive hintings, ſuch, as ſhould they be ſwallowed, would ſend up into unſteady Brains, vain and phanatick vapors, and fill them with a diſmal and a vertigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous giddineſs. It is called <hi>(An Expedient for the preventing any difference between his Highneſs and the Parliament,)</hi> when the Remedy that is preſcribed, is the very Seed and Sperm, the very Nurſery, and Fomenter, and Vivary of that differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: For the <hi>Recognition,</hi> the <hi>Negative Voice,</hi> and the <hi>Militia,</hi> what is ſaid unto them, ſhall receive their cenſure and ſolution, according as they ſhall fall in thoſe places that the Printed Paper has allotted them. Onely concerning the Author, I ſhall ſay but this little, which is in effect his own words, That he is <hi>A nameleſs Lover of his Countrey.</hi> And however the great Byaſs of ſome ſpecial intereſt or ſelf-end may lean ſo hard upon his judgment, that it may make it ſtand bent, yet ſurely his parts are great, and ſo no doubt is his policy, which he poſſibly may make uſe of to his deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed advantage: For ſince it is a Maxime, <hi>That it is better to buy of Enemies, then to reward Friends;</hi> He may happily put him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf into that poſture, ſtill looking and with a purpoſe to be bought off. But I may not pretend to the knowledge of any mans thought, I ſhall leave that to the great <hi>Cordignoſtick</hi> that is above, and ſhall fall to the words that follow.</p>
            <pb n="5" facs="tcp:64116:3"/>
            <p>THe <hi>Preface,</hi> is like a ſtrong and ſubtile poiſon that boils in the veins, and works ſo powerfully upon the ſpirits, that moderation and reaſon is utterly laid by, and a mad Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion made from a ſuggeſted, a forged, and a falſe Principle. <hi>Though</hi> (ſays he) <hi>I look not upon the preſent Diſpute about the</hi> Negative Voice <hi>and the Command of the</hi> Militia, <hi>as like to give us much trouble; (For, Uſurpations and Tyrannies once judged by God, never recover to riſe again in the ſame form:) Yet to ſatisfie thoſe doubts and fears of thoſe honeſt Souls who ſee not what ſtrength they have on their ſide, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mark in what ſlie, in what amphibious, in what Epecine inſinuations he endeavors to wimble himſelf into the belief of thoſe honeſt ſouls whom he tearms ſo, whom he hood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>winks and muffles, and even reeſes and ſmoaks with doubts and fears, that he may amuſe them and blind their eyes, which could not elſe but ſee the Impoſture and the <hi>Hocus-Pocus</hi> which he uſeth. He looks not upon the preſent Diſpute about the <hi>Negative Voice</hi> and the <hi>Militia,</hi> as like to give much trouble; when there is no Diſpute about it, (unleſs the clandeſtine and ſlie Redarguings that are occultly laid down in this printed paper be that Diſpute, or be a riſe and fomentation to ſuch a Diſpute) nor indeed can there be, in any right reaſon, unleſs there be a dividing the bark from the tree, or the marrow from the bone, which is the periſhing and deſtroying of both: I hope that is not the intention, though the words <hi>Uſurpations and Tyrannies</hi> bear but an il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>favored, and an incongruous, and a ſplenatick interpretation, and have the ſmatch and reliſh, and rank taſte of the ſpirit of envy, if not of rebellion. Beſides when 'tis added, <hi>There is reaſon and equity ſufficient to ſtop the mouth of ſuch a claim by any ſingle perſon in this Nation;</hi> Is not this ſpeaking out as the Jews of old, <hi>We will not have this man reign over us?</hi> We will not have this man our Supreme Magiſtrate: Or if our Supreme, his Supremacie ſhall be ſo manacled, and ſo fettered, and ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained, as the Heathens Idols were of old, who were chained
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:64116:4"/>up with golden chains, leſt at any time they ſhould depart from them, or do hurt to them: Or we'll make him ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent, and bring him to ſuch a paſs, that we'll do with him as the Perſians did with their god <hi>Fire,</hi> whom upon the leaſt diſguſt they would take and carry to the Water, and threaten his extinguiſhment, if he denied them any thing.</p>
            <p>But I ſhall haſten from theſe ill-boding foggs, as from the opening of a noiſom Vault, which ſends forth ſuch a peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lential Vapor that oftentimes doth ſtrike the head with a ſtupifying dizineſs, and oftentimes with Lethargies which lead to death: And I ſhall come to the riſe and occaſion of this Government, whereby the nature and power of it will beſt appear; which is ſet down in the firſt Section.</p>

               <p>And here little more needs to be added for the clearing and aſſerting the indubitable Rights of this preſent Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, then what may be gathered from the words and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſions that are laid down in the Section it ſelf. <hi>The preſent form of Government</hi> (faith he) <hi>as it varies from a Republique, was begotten by Neceſsity.</hi> See, the very life and ground of any Action, that may render it authentick and paſſable, is the Neceſſity of it; and this Neceſſity by his own conceſſion was the parent and ſire of this Government. And if, as the proverb is, <hi>Neceſsity has no law,</hi> or be above law, or be at leaſt a law to it ſelf; what childiſh and untoward waywardneſs is it, to diſpute or conteſt, or any ways to limit or recall a vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary act of this great Maſter?</p>
               <p>It was found that the Parliament, by long ſtanding, like water, grew corrupt and putrid, and was as gall and worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood, or the potion of Jealouſie to all palats; it was not only bitter, but it cauſed ſwellings, even ſwellings and riſings of heart: So that (as 'tis confeſſed) <hi>the people threw them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into the arms and protection of his preſent Highneſs late Father</hi> (of bleſſed memory) <hi>whom they found ſo ſtout and ſo
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:64116:4"/>faithful, (and withal ſucceſsful) that they looked for all peace and happineſs</hi> (in which they were not at all deceived) <hi>under his moſt wiſe and prudent government.</hi> Well, this being freely done, and by the <hi>honeſt people</hi> (as he ſays) <hi>who were acceſſory to the devolving the Power here;</hi> wherefore is the voice of murmuring and diſſatisfaction heard? why is there a ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition now only of his truth and righteouſneſs? why doth he come with a <hi>Non putavi,</hi> 'twas never dream'd nor thought of <hi>A Monarchal or Family-intereſt?</hi> As if they had acted hand over head and knew not what they did, (which would be loth to be owned) and yet it muſt be ſo, or the Author muſt be ſaid not to know what he writes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>There were other wiſer heads</hi> (as he calls them) <hi>that by their high Places had approached nearer this temptation in their own hearts, which did foreſee and were aware what might be the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence and product of this overhaſty credulity and truſt, as afterwards indeed it came to paſs.</hi> And here lies the rancor and ſpightfulneſs that makes him even foam at the mouth, that there were thoughts of heart by ſome in high places, that their turn might be next: And to ſee themſelves Tantalized and plaid at Chop-cherry with, by the gliſterings only and ſhews of a Crown, which they have miſſed of, this is a goad in the ſide, a thorn in the eye, and as the thruſting through with a ſword.</p>

               <p>The ſecond Section begins ſomething ſmoothly, but yet is but as the playing of the <hi>Porpus</hi> before a ſtorm. <hi>The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector</hi> (ſays he) <hi>did clearly run Bias to the honest Intentions of thoſe that wiſht him the adminiſtration of the Power, when he made himſelf a Civil Ruler.</hi> See here a contradiction: They wiſht him the adminiſtration of the Power; and the next words, He made himſelf. a Civil Ruler. What was then upon the hearts and wiſhes of thoſe that were inſtrumental to his late Highneſſes moſt deſerved advancement to the Supreme au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:64116:5"/>lies not in my diſcernment, no otherwiſe then by a demonſtrative conjecture, which leads me to a belief that they really wiſhed what they ſo willingly acted, and that they would not have been ſo ready and ſo ſollicitous to make him a Protector, that they would ever afterwards wiſh him to be otherwiſe; eſpecially it being (as he ſays) <hi>that changes in States and Governments being brought forth with ſuch pangs and throwes as are very uneaſie and dangerous, and ſo they may not be imagined to be every days work:</hi> Therefore it was indeed in vain to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract or withdraw the truſt committed, or to divorce the <hi>Militia</hi> from the Scepter, either in his Perſon, or in the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of his Succeſſor; for be it what it will, <hi>That was fought againſt in the perſon of the late King.</hi> This I am certain of, That take away the Power of the Power, take away the <hi>Militia</hi> from the Protectorſhip, take away the Sword from the Magiſtrate, and then the Power, and the Protectorſhip, and the Magiſtracy will be but like great Gilt Letters, and all Conſonants without Vowels, which at beſt will make but a harſh and inſignificant noiſe: Where the power of Compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling is taken away, the deſire of Serving grows quickly cold, abates and dies.</p>

'Tis called <hi>Hereditary ſucceſsion,</hi> and (by his own words) <hi>there was then in Parliament powerful ſtrivings for Hereditary ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsion.</hi> Now ſhould that have taken place, the buds of all others hopes had been nipt, their branches that ways had been lopt off, and their very roots had been laid bare and digg'd up: Therefore to keep up their ſpirits from a deſpondencie, and an utter dying in them, <hi>The Nomination of the Immediate Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsion
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:64116:5"/>was indulged</hi> (as 'tis phraſed) <hi>to his late Highneſs; and that but upon a very high confidence of the ſpirit, and principles of his late Highneſs, to carry him above all private reſpects, in the executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the truſt of Nomination.</hi> By this 'tis plain and evident what is drove at; Hereditary ſucceſſion is twice named, and once hinted in the words, <hi>Above all private reſpects, in the truſt of Nomination.</hi> So that had his late Highneſs waved all his own Relations and concernments, had he ſhut up his Princely bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els of nature and humanity, and paſſing by his own Illuſtrious Sons, had pitch'd upon the Nomination of one of thoſe that looked, and long'd, and hoped, and lingred after it; then queſtion not but Hereditary ſucceſſion had gone down eaſily, then the Match betwixt the <hi>Militia</hi> and the <hi>Scepter</hi> had ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted of no ſcruples, and it ſhould have been too late for any to forbid the banes. But in regard he did nominate for his Succeſſor his Royal Son (whom God long preſerve) from hence theſe fretful, peeviſh ſcruples do ariſe.</p>

               </head>
               <p>In this Section, and in the other that follows, there is, as I may ſo ſay, a Scale of Votes. 'Tis put to the Queſtion, Whether or no his preſent Highneſs being in poſſeſſion of the Government, may not therewith take the power of the <hi>Militia</hi> which was inveſted in his Father? And whether the <hi>Negative Voice</hi> alſo deſcends not unto him with the Civil Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment? 'Tis reſolved by the Author negatively: The ground he lays muſt be viewed. For the <hi>Militia</hi> (he ſays) it is true, the ſupreme Command of all the Armies in the Three Nations was in his late Highneſs, but not as he was Protector, but as he was General, which he was before he was Protector; ſo that the Protector or Civil Government was annexed to the <hi>Militia,</hi> not the <hi>Militia</hi> to the Civil Government, &amp;c. To the ſolution of this, I muſt have recourſe to the <hi>Humble
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:64116:6"/>Petition and Advice,</hi> where the confuſion being foreſeen that might commence for want of a Nomination of a Succeſſor, It was petitioned to his late Highneſs in theſe words; <hi>That your Highneſs would be pleaſed during your life-time to appoint and declare the Perſon who ſhall immediately after your death ſucceed you in the Government of theſe Nations.</hi> Which his late Highneſs accordingly did; he nominated and appointed the moſt Illuſtrious <hi>RICHARD</hi> to ſucceed him in the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the three Nations. Now could it be ſuppoſed that he would have him ſucceed in part of his Government, and not in the whole? Or can it be imagined that he would ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point him to the Scepter, and leave the <hi>Militia</hi> in the power and at the diſpoſe of any other perſon? eſpecially ſince 'tis alleaged by the Author, that the Military power and capacity muſt ſerve as a ſtrength and ſecurity to the perſon of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector, in the due exerciſe of the power of Civil adminiſtration (be it) onely intruſted with him. So that if the now preſent Protector be to adminiſter Juſtice, as undoubtedly he is, and ever will do, it would be but an idle dream to think he either ſhould or could do it, ſhould the ſword of Juſtice be ever wreſted from his hand: Or if he be lookt upon as a Protection and a Defence unto his people under his dominions, how can that great benefit be reaſonably expected, when he ſhall be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted of all power and means to do it? So that whatever power was thought fit to be intruſted in the perſon of his late High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, (which was indeed, and alſo thought fit for all the power the three Nations could caſt upon him) whatever truſt was repoſed in him under what capacity ſoever, whether as General or Protector, or Protector or General, or both, or more, the ſame power, the ſame truſt indubitably is devolved upon the perſon of his now preſent Highneſs. Firſt by the <hi>Humble Petition and Advice</hi> it was thrown upon his late High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and according to that Petition and Advice, it is now thrown upon the preſent Protector. And I queſtion not but that we ſhall have all great cauſe to bleſs God, that hath ſet over us ſo good and ſo pious a Ruler, one who is of ſuch a
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:64116:6"/>ſpirit, of ſuch Integrity and Faithfulneſs, that it may be as juſtly ſaid of his Highneſs, as it was of his late renowned Father, <hi>The like qualified Perſon is not to be found in the Three Nations.</hi>

               </head>
               <p>In the next place comes the other Vote, which is paſſed to the condemning the <hi>Negative Voice. The Negative Voice</hi> (ſays he) <hi>was never diſputed with his late Highneſs (where it was ſuffered to ſleep as in a ſafe hand) for his Perſonal Vertues.</hi> If it was never diſputed with his late Highneſs, why is it diſputed now? And if it was ſuffered to ſleep in his days, as in a ſafe hand, why is it not ſuffered to ſleep in thoſe hands now, which aſſuredly are as ſafe? And were not his preſent High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs endued with Perſonal Vertues more then ordinary, he would not certainly ſuffer ſuch harſh and unpleaſant Speeches to paſs by without ſome eminent reſentment: For whereas it is urged, That his late Highneſs for his Perſonal Vertues had the Negative Voice ſleeping by him, as in a ſafe hand, without the leaſt queſtion, may it not be reaſonably, if not neceſſarily inferred, That ſince the buſineſs is in diſpute with his preſent Highneſs, that the eclipſing or abating of ſuch Perſonal Vertues in him (which I renounce the thought of) is laid as the ground and riſe of this diſpute? And if the Negative Voice may not be concredited nor truſted with any Power, or Perſon, ſince the taking away the King or Kingly Government, why was it truſted ſo before in the hands of his Highneſs Father? And if with him, is it ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable that it ſhould be given up, or abate, or go leſs now?</p>
               <p>And whereas it is alleaged to be <hi>a thing ſuperfluous as well as dangerous,</hi> to grant the Supreme Power a Negative Voice; for that its deem'd the Parliament to be quick ſighted enough, and <hi>to be ſo wiſe in their generation as to be able to judge, what
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:64116:7"/>is good and behoveful for the Nation, wherein their ſtakes and intereſts lie.</hi> It is eaſily granted, That they can ſpy enough as to their own concerns and intereſts, but whether or no, if they be left at large, and to do what ever they pleaſe, they may not poſſibly at ſometime or other be tampering with that, that may not at all ſute with the conveniency and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment of another. The words following have an odde tang with them, <hi>In a Commonwealth</hi> (ſays he) <hi>as we are (or ſhould be) no diſtinct Perſon or Family-Intereſt, ought to be owned.</hi> And this is not the firſt time he has been up with this Family Intereſt in this Paper, by which it appears, that the word is hard of digeſtion, and lies very heavy upon his ſtomack, as you will further ſee in the next Section.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="6" type="section">
               <head>Sect. <hi>VI.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>Here is the Negative Voice quite out of doors, and put to Kennel (as it were) with Kingſhip; and having by this the World in a ſtring, as may be imagined, they here proceed to run riot, and with full cry they purſue and hunt, both the Supreme Power, and the Other Houſe.</p>
               <p>Firſt, (he ſays) <hi>We have no Civil Head now that is Maſter of the Commonwealth, but a Servant to it, (though an honor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Servant, and it is fit he ſhould be ſo maintained.)</hi> It is true, though the greateſt Prince be but a Servant to his Countrey, out of meer Natural Love and Affection, yet it was never diſputed, but that the Supreme Ruler, was ſtiled and owned to be a Civil Head.</p>
               <p>And yet one thing more may be hinted as to the Servant (whom they term ſo) how honorable and glorious ſoever they may nominate him, and how liberal and large ſoever his Exhibition and Maintenance may be, yet it is not always ſafe to give too over-haſty a credulity and reliance upon ſome Maſters. But the reſolution he ſays is eaſie, and it may be
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:64116:7"/>ſo; for it is like <hi>Penelopes</hi> Web, that one hand unravels what the other makes up.</p>
               <p>Firſt, he ſays, <hi>Let his preſent Highneſs be acknowledged and confirmed as Supreme Magiſtrate in theſe Three Nations;</hi> and next he ſays, <hi>Let the Officers of the Army chuſe their General, and let him have his Commiſsion from the Protector and Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> If this laſt be granted, and that the Officers chuſe their General, it is in anothers Breſt whether the firſt ſhall ſtand good or no; or whether his preſent Highneſs ſhall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed be acknowledged or confirmed as the Supreme Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate in the Three Nations, which is evident by the next Propoſition, which is accented thus.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Let his Highneſs, now being with the Parliament, have the power of diſpoſing and commanding theſe Forces, and of making War and Peace.</hi> So that the ſenſe is obvious, That whilſt his Highneſs is with the Parliament, he ſhall command the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces (if his Commands will be hearkned too, when there is another General) but when the Parliament breaks up, then he ſhall have no ſuch power; which is further intimated in the following words.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A ſingle perſon</hi> (ſays he) <hi>cannot hurt us, if an unfit power be not concredited and intruſted with him;</hi> and what that unfit power is, it cannot be ſurmiſed, unleſs it be the power of the whole Army; and if that may not be truſted with his High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, with what ſafety may he truſt it in anothers hands, and put it out of his own.</p>
               <p>But it is frankly granted, That the ſingle Perſon may ſtand; for (ſays he) <hi>when we engaged againſt a King, it was not againſt a ſingle Perſon ſimply but ſo circumſtanced as Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, Tyrannical, with a luxurious Court, &amp;c. We engaged not against what might be uſeful (no Rational man would do) but what we found hurtful: Therefore the ſingle Perſon may ſtand.</hi> It is poſſibly he may do ſo, but how, or how long, or with what ſafety, there's the Quere; for the next words are omi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous and direfully portentous. <hi>We gave not up the ſubſtance
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:64116:8"/>of our Cauſe, be not baffled in that,</hi> ſays he; and with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gemination, <hi>give not up the very heart and ſubſtance of our Cauſe, part not with that.</hi> And what that Cauſe may produce, and what ſad effects that may beget; the great God above onely knows, who onely knows what might be meant by that Cauſe: For whilſt the Officers in the Army are covertly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited to keep their integrity (as queſtionleſs they will, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as they have vouched it, and proteſted it to their lives and fortunes) I hope it is no other integrity, nor to no other Perſon then to his preſent Highneſs, who ought of ſpecial right to be inveſted <hi>Generaliſsimo,</hi> and to have the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary and ſole Command of the Army, and to have not meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly an Honorable, but the onely Intereſt in the commanding the <hi>Militia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now for the Other Houſe (as he calls them) he gives them a ſhort paſs and ſends them away, ſome to go whither they will, and others (whom the Parliament ſhall think fit) to paſs into the Council of State: Never heeding, nor ſo much as caſting an eye upon the <hi>Humble Petition and Advice,</hi> which plainly ſays, <hi>That the perſons ſo Summoned and Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled together</hi> (it is laid down before, how, and by whom, and after what manner, and how many ſhall be called) <hi>ſhall be, and are hereby declared to be the Other Houſe of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, and ſhall and may without further Approbation of this Houſe</hi> (meaning the Houſe of Commons) <hi>from ſuch time of their meeting, proceed to do, and perform all ſuch matters and things, as the Other Houſe of Parliament.</hi> So that if they are conſtituted a Houſe of Lords, meerly with the ſingle Impreſs of the Supreme Signature, and Summon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, without any further Approbation of the Houſe of Commons, whom he calls the Parliament, then hands off for any Perſon or Perſons elſe to intermeddle with them, or to diſpute their exiſtency, or to limit and binde up their power.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Humble Petition and Advice</hi> hath butted and bounded
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:64116:8"/>our Intereſts, that there might not be any ſtraying in our thoughts of new Models or Platforms of Government; there were preſumptuous thoughts of old in ſome Aſtrolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, that made them give out (how vainly it is eaſily ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined) That if they had been at the making of the Heavens, they would have contrived them better, and put a goodlier ſhape upon them, then now they have. Such a ſpirit of giddineſs hath poſſeſt ſome brains now, that they could form a better Commonwealth, beyond that of the fancied <hi>Utopia,</hi> that they could make better Laws, a better Government, a better Governor; and that makes their fingers ſo buſie, and to nib ſo about the Knot that ties up, and is the very Bond of our Peace.</p>
               <p>To conclude, (I may ſay it with ſorrow) See if the grudging ſpirit of the revolting Iſraelites be not ſtrayed and got into ſome boſoms here amongſt us. The Scripture at large records it, and it cannot be unknown to any man of any reading, what <hi>Gideon</hi> did for the deliverance of <hi>Iſrael:</hi> The <hi>Midianites</hi> oppreſſed them ſore, ſo that they were forced to make themſelves dens in the mountains and caves in the rocks to hide themſelves; there was left no ſuſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance for <hi>Iſrael,</hi> neither Sheep, nor Oxe, nor Aſs; they had Enemies like Graſhoppers for multitude, and they and their camels were without number; they could make no reſiſtance: And yet in theſe ſtraits the Lord raiſed up <hi>Gideon,</hi> and by a handfull of men with a few pitchers and lamps he delivered them from all their Enemies: Upon this the men of <hi>Iſrael</hi> cry up a <hi>Gideon! Rule thou over us, both thou, and thy ſon, and thy ſons ſon! And they had reſt forty years.</hi> But <hi>Gideon</hi> dies, and mark their ingratitude, <hi>They ſhewed no kindneſs to the houſe of Gideon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Are not there ſome ſuch ſpirits in this Nation! Was not his late Highneſs, of precious memory, as another <hi>Gideon</hi> to this Nation? Might it not be ſaid of him, as the Angel ſaid to <hi>Gideon, The Lord is with thee, thou valiant man?</hi>
                  <pb n="16" facs="tcp:64116:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>Were not our fears horrible fears, and our Enemies many Enemies? and not only ſo, but were they not potent Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies? were not they politique Enemies? were they not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>betted by moſt of the Chriſtian Nations, beſides their own Party, and that no ſmall one, in our very bowels, and in the heart of our Nation among us? And yet this our <hi>Gideon,</hi> though with many and ſore Battels, gave us at length our. Liberties which we now enjoy. Did not this our <hi>Gideon</hi> highly merit at our hands, to lift him up, and to cry, <hi>Do thou and thy ſon, and thy ſons ſon rule over us!</hi> But this our <hi>Gideon</hi> now reſts from his labors: And what kindneſs is ſhewed to the Houſe of this <hi>Jerubbaal,</hi> this our <hi>Gideon,</hi> the Printed Paper to which this is intended as an Anſwer, will plainly ſhew.</p>
